# Barbershop-Website-Redesign
The concept of this project was about analyzing the current website of an Australian small business and considering how I would be able to redesign the website to benefit the business.

In the first stage of the project, high-fidelity mockups were created to complete the initial step towards redesigning the website. In the second phase, the target demographic, WCAG accessibility guidelines, and visual design styles were taken into account to create a new redesign that presents a more up-to-date and interactive webpage, still catering to the original target audience..
